Card War Game simulation where the computer plays itself
Card War is a game where the deck of 52 cards are divided equally between two players, 
then each player plays one card from whoever has higher value wins all the cards currently being played.
if both cards played are equal then 'WAR' begins
In war each player puts aside certain number of cards (10 in this case) and plays the immediate next card to determine the winner
Whoever has higher value wins all the cards currently being played
At last if any Player does not have minimum cards to play, loses

Remember it's a very long game that's why I've used 10 cards at the time of 'WAR' you cam change this easily in the code
